# Data-Link-Layer-Simulation
A simulation in OMNeT++ (C++) for data link layer protocols over a noisy channel, implementing Go-Back-N ARQ, Byte Stuffing for framing, and Parity Byte for error detection. It simulates packet loss, duplication, modification, and delay, logging transmission events for analysis.
